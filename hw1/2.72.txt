a. 
The conditional in this code always succeeds because the return type of sizeof() is size_t, which happens to be unsigned
Because it is unsigned, the subtraction between the two in the conditional is evaluated as unsigned arithmetic, always yielding a number greater than or equal to 0.
b.
To fix it, you can replace the conditional statement with simply

(maxbytes>=sizeof(val))
