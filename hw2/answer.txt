a. 
x is held by %rdi
n is held by %esi and %ecx
result is held by %rax
mask is held by %rdx

b.
The initial vlue of result is 0
The initial value of mask is 1

c. 
The test condition for mask is if mask is not equal to 0. The testq of %rdx,%rdx sets the zero flag to 1 if
mask is 0, otherwise the zero flag is 0. If the zero flag is 0, then the jne jumps to .L3

d.
Mask gets updated by being shifted to the left by the first 8 bits of %ecx, which is n. This is done
at the end of the loop after the body of the for loop is run.

e.
Result gets updated in the body of the for loop, where it equals the OR operator result of it and the 
product of mask&x. 

f. 
long loop(long x,long n)
{
  long result=0;
  long mask;
  for (mask=1;mask!= 0;mask=mask<< n&0xFF)
    {
      result |= (mask&x);
    }
return result;
}
